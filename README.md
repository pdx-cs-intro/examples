# Introductory Programming Examples
Bart Massey

These programs are introductory programming examples in
Python. They are being used in my CS 161 classes at Portland
State University.

* `hello.py`: Classic hello world
* `triangles.py`: Draw a picture using turtle graphics
* `iodemo.py`: Trivial I/O demo
* `ftoc.py`: Classic Fahrenheit to Celsius converter
